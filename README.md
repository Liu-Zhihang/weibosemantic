## Abstract:
The lockdowns in Wuhan and Shanghai represent significant turning points in China's COVID-19 policies, marking a transition from an aggressive zero-COVID policy to a comprehensive reopening. This shift underscores an interactive evolution between public health policies and public sentiment. Utilizing natural language processing to analyze Weibo text data, this study explores the evolution and spatiotemporal characteristics of the public's emotional response to COVID-19 containment policies in Wuhan and Shanghai. The impact of stringent containment policies on public sentiment at critical moments shows a causal effect, reflecting shifts in public focus during different pandemic phases. Public sentiment gradually shifted from initial positive support to negative reactions towards containment policies. This transformation in sentiment is spatially constrained by socio-economic attributes of the public's regions, such as areas with higher populations of youth and elderly exhibiting stronger resistance to containment policies. The rise of 'pandemic fatigue' and concerns about the side effects of these measures are evident. Factors like the intensity of containment policies, the severity of the pandemic, and the duration of the outbreak influence the degree of negative sentiment, potentially leading to public distrust, conspiracy theories, and protests. This research provides valuable insights for policymakers in implementing targeted measures and demonstrates an effective method for tracking and analyzing public sentiment changes during crises.
